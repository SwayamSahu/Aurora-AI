# Aurora — AI Video Generation Platform

An open-source platform to **generate** AI videos (text→video, image→video), **enrich** them with AI voiceover, auto-subtitles, images and music, and **edit** everything on a professional multi-track timeline before exporting a final MP4.

Built entirely with free & open-source software. Developed on macOS (Apple Silicon, CPU/mock) and deployed on an NVIDIA 16GB GPU for real model inference.

The **generator backend is swappable** via `GENERATOR_BACKEND`:
- `mock` — returns real fixture media instantly. Full app is built & tested on the Mac with this.
- `cuda` — runs real models (LTX-Video, CogVideoX, SVD, FLUX/SDXL, MusicGen) on the NVIDIA box.

FFmpeg, TTS and Whisper transcription are **real on both platforms** (CPU-capable), so only diffusion generation is deferred to the GPU phase.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `frontend/` | Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui. All UI screens & the timeline editor. |
| `backend/` | FastAPI app, Celery workers, generators, media/FFmpeg pipeline. |
| `infra/` | Docker Compose (`compose.dev.yml` for Mac, `compose.gpu.yml` for the NVIDIA box). |
| `docs/` | Architecture, API reference, GPU transfer runbook. |
| `scripts/` | Dev seed data, model download (GPU box only). |

## Quick start (development, macOS)

Prerequisites: Node 20+, Python 3.11+, Docker Desktop.

```bash
# 1. Start infra (Postgres, Redis, MinIO) + backend + frontend
docker compose -f infra/compose.dev.yml up --build

# Frontend:  http://localhost:3000
# API docs:  http://localhost:8000/docs
# MinIO:     http://localhost:9001
```

See `docs/` for local (non-Docker) development of each part.

## Build phases

This project is built in phases — non-GPU work is fully developed and tested on the Mac (Phases 0–8); GPU model integration and testing happen last on the NVIDIA box (Phase 9). See `docs/roadmap.md`.

## License

The platform code is MIT. Bundled AI models retain their own licenses — see `docs/model-licenses.md`.
