# Build Roadmap

Non-GPU work (Phases 0–8) is fully developed **and tested** on the MacBook (Apple Silicon, CPU/mock).
GPU model integration and testing (Phase 9) happen on the NVIDIA 16GB box via RDP.

| 5 | Timeline editor core | Mac | ✅ done |
| 6 | Real TTS voiceover + real Whisper captions + text overlays | Mac | ✅ done |
| 7 | Real FFmpeg render & export | Mac | ✅ done |
| 8 | Hardening, polish, accessibility, GPU code written (not run) | Mac | ✅ done |
| **9** | Swap to CUDA generators, download weights, tune for 16GB VRAM, GPU E2E | NVIDIA (RDP) | ⬜ |

- [x] `app/generators/cuda/vram.py` — one-model-at-a-time VRAM manager (evict + gc + cache flush)
- [x] Registry already wired: `get_video_generator()` etc. import from `app.generators.cuda` when `GENERATOR_BACKEND=cuda`
- [x] `scripts/download_gpu_models.sh` — pre-downloads all weights to `HF_HOME` (~36 GB total)
- [x] Prod error masking: global `Exception` handler in `app/main.py` returns generic 500 JSON (hides tracebacks in production)
- [x] React `ErrorBoundary` component (`components/shared/error-boundary.tsx`) wrapping the workspace layout
- [x] Clip block keyboard accessibility: `onKeyDown` Delete/Backspace removes clip; `aria-label` with kind + name + duration
- [x] Transition badge: tiny pill on clip bottom-left shows transition type (e.g. "fade") when set
- [x] Test gate: **85 backend + 13 frontend unit tests pass**; ruff + lint/typecheck/build green
